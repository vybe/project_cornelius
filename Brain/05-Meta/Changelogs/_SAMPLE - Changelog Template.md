# CHANGELOG - [Session Type] YYYY-MM-DD

## Session Overview

**Objective**: What was the goal of this session?
**Method**: How was it conducted?
**Notes Analyzed**: Number of notes examined
**Connections Found**: Number of new connections discovered
**Emergent Patterns**: Number of major patterns identified

---

## Major Discoveries

### 1. [Discovery Title]

**Connection**: [[Note A]] ↔ [[Note B]]

**Insight**: What was discovered? Why is this connection meaningful?

**Similarity Score**: 0.XX (semantic similarity if applicable)

**Synthesis Opportunity**: What could you create from this?

### 2. [Discovery Title]

[Repeat structure]

---

## Emergent Patterns

### Pattern 1: [Pattern Name]

**Description**: What pattern was noticed across multiple notes?

**Notes involved**:
- [[Note 1]]
- [[Note 2]]
- [[Note 3]]

**Significance**: Why does this pattern matter?

**Synthesis Opportunity**: What framework/article could emerge?

---

## Bridge Notes Identified

### Existing Bridge Notes (Confirmed)
1. [[Bridge Note 1]] - Connects [Domain A] ↔ [Domain B] ↔ [Domain C]

### New Bridge Notes to Create
1. **Proposed**: "[Title of potential bridge note]"
   - Would connect: [Domain/Topic A] ↔ [Domain/Topic B]
   - Why it's valuable: [Explanation]

---

## Network Topology Insights

### Cluster Analysis
- **[Topic] cluster**: High/Medium/Low density, connectivity notes
- **Hub status**: Which notes are emerging as hubs?

### Isolated Notes (Candidates for Connection)
Found X notes with <3 connections:
- [[Isolated Note 1]] - Could connect to [Topic]
- [[Isolated Note 2]] - Could connect to [Topic]

**Action**: Run targeted connection finding on these

---

## Statistics

- **Total notes sampled**: XX
- **Domains covered**: X
- **Strong connections found**: X
- **Moderate connections found**: X
- **Average similarity score**: 0.XX
- **Bridge notes identified**: X existing, X proposed
- **Emergent patterns**: X major themes
- **Consilience zones**: X identified

---

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Action 1**: Specific task with context
2. **Action 2**: Specific task with context
3. **Action 3**: Specific task with context
4. **Action 4**: Specific task with context
5. **Action 5**: Specific task with context

---

## Meta-Insights

**What This Session Revealed About the Knowledge Base**:
- Insight about overall structure
- Insight about maturity level
- Insight about emerging themes
- Insight about synthesis readiness

**Evolution Since Last Session** (YYYY-MM-DD):
- +XX new permanent notes

## Template Notes

**Delete this section when creating actual changelogs!**

### Session Types

**Auto-Discovery**:
- Random sampling across domains
- Target non-obvious connections (0.50-0.70 similarity)
- Focus on serendipity and surprise
- Run monthly

**Connection Discovery**:
- Targeted exploration around specific note/topic
- Comprehensive analysis of one area
- Higher similarity range (0.65-0.95)
- Run when actively working on something

**Vault Management**:
- Batch CRUD operations
- Organization changes
- Metadata updates
- Note migration

**Insight Extraction**:
- Processing source material
- Creating permanent notes from content
- AI extraction review and validation

### Key Elements

Every changelog should have:
1. **Session metadata** (date, time, type, duration)
2. **Overview** with key stats
3. **Major discoveries** detailed
4. **Emergent patterns** documented
5. **Network insights** if applicable
6. **Statistics** for tracking
7. **Recommended actions** for follow-up
8. **Meta-insights** about evolution

### Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Name actual notes with wikilinks
- **Show connections**: Explain WHY things connect
- **Track evolution**: Compare to previous sessions
- **Actionable**: Always include next steps
- **Comprehensive**: Include enough detail to remember later
