## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Capture (00-Inbox/)
- Drop quick thoughts in `Quick Captures/`
- Store AI-extracted content in `Content Extractions/`
- **Don't organize yet** - just capture

### 2. Process (01-Sources/ → 02-Permanent/)
- Create source notes for books/articles in `01-Sources/`
- Extract atomic insights into `02-Permanent/`
- Link permanent notes back to sources

### 3. Organize (03-MOCs/)
- Create MOCs when you have 15+ notes on a theme
- Start with `MOC - Master Navigation` as your home base
- Build thematic navigation hubs

### 4. Synthesize & Create (04-Output/)
- Write articles synthesizing multiple notes
- Develop frameworks from patterns
- Capture short insights
- Document open research questions

### 5. Track (05-Meta/)
- Review changelogs from discovery sessions
- Use templates for consistency
- Document your workflows

## 📝 Key Concepts

### Atomic Notes (02-Permanent/)
- **One idea per note** - Keep focused
- **Your own words** - Rephrase, don't copy
- **Clear title** - Make insight obvious
- **Source attribution** - Link back
- **Connections** - Link to related notes

### MOCs (03-MOCs/)
- **Navigation hubs** - Not categories
- **Thematic clusters** - Group by meaning
- **Living documents** - Update regularly
- **Start with Master** - Create MOC - Master Navigation first

### Changelogs (05-Meta/Changelogs/)
- **Dated files** - One per session
- **Discovery logs** - What did agents find?
- **Pattern tracking** - Evolution over time
- **Actionable insights** - What to do next

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Daily
- Empty `00-Inbox/Quick Captures/` into permanent notes
- Process 1-2 items from `Content Extractions/`
- Review recent permanent notes

### Weekly
- Run `/find-connections` on new notes
- Update relevant MOCs
- Review latest changelogs
- Plan synthesis opportunities

### Monthly
- Run auto-discovery agent
- Review all changelogs
- Create/update frameworks
- Write synthesis articles

## 🔍 Quick Navigation

**Looking for something?**
- `/search-vault <query>` - Quick search
- `/recall <topic>` - Deep exploration
- `/find-connections <note>` - Discover relationships
- Start at: `03-MOCs/MOC - Master Navigation.md`

## 📚 Sample Workflows

### Processing a Book
1. Read and highlight
2. Create source note in `01-Sources/Books/`
3. Extract permanent notes to `02-Permanent/`
4. Run `/find-connections` on new notes
5. Update relevant MOCs
6. Review changelog

### Writing an Article
1. Start with a theme or question
2. Run `/find-connections <theme>`
3. Review suggested connections
4. Create outline in `04-Output/Articles/`
5. Synthesize permanent notes
6. Write article

### Weekly Discovery
1. Review notes from this week
2. Run `/find-connections` on each major note
3. Update MOCs
4. Document patterns in changelog
5. Identify synthesis opportunities
