# Clear Title That States The Insight

One or two sentences expressing the core insight in your own words. This should be the main idea you want to remember.

Expand with 1-2 paragraphs providing context, explanation, or implications. Keep it focused on a single idea—if you find yourself wanting to explain multiple concepts, create separate notes.

**Why this matters**: Brief explanation of the significance or practical application of this insight.

**Source**: [[Source Note Name]] or [[Book Title - Source Notes]]

**Related concepts**:
- [[Related Note 1]] - How they connect
- [[Related Note 2]] - How they connect
- [[Contrasting Note]] - How they differ

**Examples**: (Optional - if concrete examples help)
- Example 1
- Example 2

## 📝 Guidelines for Permanent Notes

### Structure
- **Title**: Make the insight obvious (not "Chapter 3 Notes" but "Dopamine drives motivation, not pleasure")
- **Content**: 50-300 words ideal (avg 13 lines)
- **One idea**: If you have multiple ideas, create multiple notes
- **Your words**: Paraphrase the source, don't copy-paste
- **Attribution**: Always link back to source

### Metadata
- **created**: Date you created this note
- **tags**: 3-5 relevant tags (topics, domains, types)
- **type**: Always `permanent` for atomic insights

### Connections
- Link to **related** notes (similar concepts)
- Link to **contrasting** notes (opposite views)
- Link to **source** notes (where this came from)
- Link to **example** notes (concrete instances)

### When to Create
- After reading a source and processing highlights
- When you have an original thought worth preserving
- When synthesizing multiple sources
- When you discover a pattern or connection

### Best Practices
- **Write for future you**: Assume you'll forget the context
- **Use your voice**: Make it personal and memorable
- **Be specific**: Vague notes are useless notes
- **Link generously**: More connections = more discoveries
- **Update as needed**: Permanent doesn't mean frozen
