# Configuration

VAULT_BASE_PATH=/path/to/your/obsidian/workspace

---

**Setup Instructions**:

1. Replace `/path/to/your/obsidian/workspace` with the path to your **Obsidian workspace folder**
2. **Important**: This should be the folder that contains your `.obsidian/` directory, NOT a specific vault subfolder
3. If you have multiple vaults, this workspace folder can contain all of them
4. After updating this path, also update `.mcp.json` to match

**Example**:
- ✅ Correct: `VAULT_BASE_PATH=/Users/yourname/Dropbox/Cornelius`
- ❌ Wrong: `VAULT_BASE_PATH=/Users/yourname/Dropbox/Cornelius/Brain`

The workspace folder structure typically looks like:
```
/YourWorkspace/
  .obsidian/          # Obsidian configuration
  Vault1/             # First vault (optional)
  Vault2/             # Second vault (optional)
  *.md files          # Or markdown files directly in workspace
```
