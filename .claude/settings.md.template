# System Configuration

## Vault Paths

### Obsidian Root (MCP Server)
OBSIDIAN_ROOT=/path/to/your/Obsidian

This is where MCP Smart Connections indexes from (the Obsidian application folder).

### Brain Vault (Your Notes)
VAULT_PATH=/path/to/your/Obsidian/Brain

This is your actual vault containing all your notes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Find your Obsidian folder structure:**
   - Locate your Obsidian installation (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Dropbox/Obsidian`)
   - This folder should contain multiple vaults (Brain, etc.)
   - Each vault has its own `.obsidian/` configuration

2. **Update OBSIDIAN_ROOT:**
   - Set to your Obsidian application folder
   - Example: `/Users/yourname/Dropbox/Obsidian`

3. **Update VAULT_PATH:**
   - Set to your specific vault folder (usually `Brain`)
   - Example: `/Users/yourname/Dropbox/Obsidian/Brain`

4. **Update `.mcp.json`:**
   - Set `SMART_VAULT_PATH` to match `OBSIDIAN_ROOT` (NOT VAULT_PATH)
   - This is a technical requirement for MCP to work

## Example Configuration

**Your folder structure:**
```
/Users/yourname/Dropbox/Obsidian/          ← OBSIDIAN_ROOT
├── .obsidian/                              ← Obsidian app config
└── Brain/                                  ← VAULT_PATH
    ├── .obsidian/                          ← Vault config
    ├── 00-Inbox/
    ├── 01-Sources/
    ├── 02-Permanent/
    └── ... other folders
```

**Your settings should be:**
```
OBSIDIAN_ROOT=/Users/yourname/Dropbox/Obsidian
VAULT_PATH=/Users/yourname/Dropbox/Obsidian/Brain
```

## Important Notes

- **MCP must point to Obsidian root** - Technical requirement
- **Your notes are in the Brain subfolder** - File operations target this
- **MCP search results** use paths like `Brain/02-Permanent/Note.md`
- After updating, run `/switch-brain` command or manually update `.mcp.json`
